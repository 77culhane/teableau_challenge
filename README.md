## Write Up

My first plots on the Bike data for Jersey City charted over the course of 2018 show that bike usage is overwhelmingly clustered in the city center. It also shows that trips tend to be comparatively short in the city center vs the outermost stations. Given these insights, it's likely there are a select few bike users who use citibikes to commute between the urban and suburban sections of the city.

What did come as a surprise is that many outer/suburban city stations to not appear as trip origin points, not even once for the entire year of data. Those to the east and northeast of the city center only appear with single occurrences of use for trip endpoints. It appears that the outer stations are used by a vanishingly small population as a trip endpoint, but never as a trip origin point. The average trip durations for this population are, expectedly, much longer than than those in the city center. This population likely bikes from the city center, possibly as an outbound commute.
